                <p>Headaches are a very common condition that most people will experience many times
                    during their lives. The main symptom of a headache is pain in your head or face. This can be
                    throbbing, constant, sharp, or dull. Headaches can be treated with medication, stress management,  and biofeedback.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                <p>The multidisciplinary team takes a new approach to headaches.</p>
                <h5>How common are headaches in adults?</h5><br>
                <p> your head is throbbing, you’re not alone. Headache is one of the most common pain conditions in the world. Up to 75% of adults
                    worldwide have had a headache in the past year.
                    Headaches are a major cause of absenteeism from work  and school. They also take a toll on social  and family life. For some people,
                    continually battling headaches can lead to feeling anxious  and depressed.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What are the types of headaches?</h5><br>
                <p>There are more than 150 types of headaches. They fall into two main categories: primary  and secondary headaches.</p>
                <h6>Primary headaches</h6><br>
                <p>Primary headaches are those that aren’t due to another medical condition. The category includes:
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cluster headaches.</li>
                    <li>Migraine.</li>
                    <li>New daily persistent headaches (NDPH).</li>
                    <li>Tension headaches.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h5> headaches</h5>
                <p>Secondary headaches are related to another medical condition, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The disease of blood vessels in the brain.</li>
                    <li>Head injury.</li>
                    <li>High blood pressure (hypertension).</li>
                    <li>Infection.</li>
                    <li>Medication overuse.</li>
                    <li>Sinus congestion.</li>
                    <li>Trauma.</li>
                    <li>Tumor.</li>
                </ul><br><br>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS  AND CAUSES</h3><br>
                <h5>Are headaches hereditary?</h5><br>
                <p>
                    Headaches tend to run in families, especially migraines. Children who have migraines usually have at least one parent
                    who also suffers from them. Kids whose parents have migraines are up to four times more likely to develop them too.</p>
                <p>Headaches can also be triggered by environmental factors shared in a family’s household, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating certain foods or ingredients, like caffeine, alcohol, fermented foods, chocolate,  and cheese.</li>
                    <li>Exposure to allergens.</li>
                    <li>Second and smoke.</li>
                    <li>Strong odors from household chemicals or perfumes.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <h5>What causes headaches?</h5><br>
                <p>Headache pain results from signals interacting among the brain, blood vessels, and surrounding nerves. During a headache, an unknown
                    mechanism activates specific nerves that affect muscles  and blood vessels. These nerves send pain signals to the brain.</p><br>

                <h5>What causes migraines?</h5><br>
                <p>Migraines aren’t fully understood. But researchers think migraines result when unstable nerve cells overreact to various factors (triggers).
                    The nerve cells send out impulses to blood vessels  and cause chemical changes in the brain. The result is disabling pain.</p><br>
                <h5>What triggers headaches  and migraines?</h5><br>
                <p>Common triggers of tension headaches or migraines include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol use.</li>
                    <li>Changes in eating or sleeping patterns.</li>
                    <li>Depression.</li>
                    <li>Emotional stress related to family  and friends, work, or school.</li>
                    <li>Excessive medication use.</li>
                    <li>Eye, neck, or back strain caused by poor posture.</li>
                    <li>Lighting.</li>
                    <li>Noise.</li>
                    <li>Weather changes</li>
                </ul><br><br>

                <h5>What do headaches feel like?</h5><br>
                <p>Headache symptoms vary, depending on the type of headache you have.</p><br>
                <h5>Tension headaches</h5><br>
                <p>Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. Tension headache pain tends to be:</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>Consistent without throbbing.</li>
                    <li>Mild to moderate.</li>
                    <li>On both sides of the head (bilateral).</li>
                    <li>Responsive to over-the-counter treatment.</li>
                    <li>Worse during routine activities (such as bending over or walking upstairs).</li>
                </ul><br><br>

                <h5>Migraines</h5><br>
                <p>Migraines are the second most common type of primary headaches. Symptoms of migraines include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Moderate to severe pain.</li>
                    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                    <li>Pounding or throbbing pain.</li>
                    <li>Pain that lasts four hours to three days.</li>
                    <li>Sensitivity to light, noise, or odors.</li>
                    <li>Stomach upset or abdominal pain.</li>
                </ul><br><br>


                <h5>Cluster headaches</h5><br>
                <p>Cluster headaches are the most severe type of primary headache. Cluster headaches come in a group or cluster, usually in the spring or fall.
                     They occur one to eight times per day during a cluster period, which may last two weeks to three months. 
                    The headaches may disappear completely (go into remission) for months or years, only to recur later. The pain of a cluster headache is:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Intense with a burning or stabbing sensation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Located behind one of your eyes or in the eye region, without changing sides.
                    </li>
                    <li>Throbbing or constant.
                    </li>
                </ul><br><br>


                <h5>New daily persistent headaches</h5><br>
                <p>New daily persistent headaches (NDPH) come on suddenly  and last for more than three months. They typically occur
                    in people who weren’t having frequent headaches before. The pain of NDPH is:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Constant  and persistent without easing up.</li>
                    <li>Located on both sides of the head.</li>
                    <li>Not responsive to medications.</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <h5>Sinus headaches</h5><br>
                <p>Sinus headaches are the result of a sinus infection, which causes congestion  and inflammation in the sinuses
                    (open passageways behind the cheeks  and forehead). People  and even healthcare providers, often mistake migraines
                    for sinus headaches. Symptoms of sinus headaches include:</P><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bad taste in the mouth.</li>
                    <li>Deep, constant pain in your cheekbones  and forehead.</li>
                    <li>Facial swelling.</li>
                    <li>Feeling of fullness in ears.</li>
                    <li>Fever.</li>
                    <li>Pain that gets worse with sudden head movement or straining.</li>
                    <li>Mucus discharge (snot).</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <h5>Medication overuse headaches</h5><br>
                <p>Medication overuse headaches (MOH) or rebound headaches affect up to 5% of people. They happen when you
                    frequently take pain relievers for headaches. Eventually, this practice can increase your number
                    of headaches. Signs of MOH include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Headaches becoming more frequent.</li>
                    <li>More days with headaches than without.</li>
                    <li>Pain that’s worse in the morning.</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <h5>Headaches in children</h5><br>
                <p>Most kids have had a headache by the time they get to high school. For about 20% of them, tension headaches  and migraines are reoccurring problems. Similar to adults, triggers for headaches in children include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain foods trigger headaches for the individual.</li>
                    <li>Changes in sleep.</li>
                    <li>Environmental factors.</li>
                    <li>Stress.</li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <h5>What headache did symptoms require immediate medical care?</h5><br>
                <p>If you or your child has any of these headache symptoms, get medical care right away:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A sudden, new, severe headache</li>

                <h3>DIAGNOSIS  AND TESTS</h3>
                <h5>How are headaches evaluated  and diagnosed?</h5><br>
                <p>If you have headaches often or if they are very severe, reach out to your healthcare provider. You can usually start with your family physician,
                    where the diagnosis process will begin. It’s important to diagnose headaches correctly so that specific therapy can be started to help you feel better.
                    Your healthcare provider will complete a physical examination, discuss your medical history  and talk to you about your headache symptoms.</p>
                <P> This conversation is part of a headache evaluation. During the headache evaluation, your provider will ask you about your headache history, including:</P><br>

                <p>You should provide your physician with a history of prior headache treatments. Tell your doctor what medications you have taken in the past  and what medications are you currently taking. Don't hesitate to list them, bring in the medication bottles, or ask your pharmacist for a printout. If any studies or tests were previously performed, bring them with you. This may save time  and repetition of tests.</p><br>
                <h5>Physical  and neurological examinations for headaches</h5><br>

                    <li>Excessive fatigue, wanting to sleep all of the time</li>
                    <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
                    <li>Balance problems, falling</li>
                    <li>Vision problems (blurry vision, double vision, blind spots)</li>
                    <li>Mental confusion or changes in personality, inappropriate behavior, speech difficulties</li>
                    <li>Seizures</li>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Nausea, vomiting</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p> Neurological tests focus on ruling out diseases that might also cause headaches, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis,  and other cerebrovascular diseases.</p><br>
                <p>A disorder of the central nervous system might be suspected in the development of serious headaches. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tumor</li>
                    <li>Abscess</li>
                    <li>Hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain)</li>
                    <li>Bacterial or viral meningitis (an infection or inflammation of the membrane that covers the brain  and spinal cord)</li>
                    <li>Pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure)</li>
                    <li>Hydrocephalus (abnormal build-up of fluid in the brain)</li>
                    <li>Infection of the brain</li>
                    <li>Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)</li>
                    <li>Blood clots</li>
                    <li>Head trauma</li>
                    <li>Sinus blockage or disease</li>
                    <li>Malformation (such as Arnold-Chiari)</li>
                    <li>Injuries</li>
                    <li>Infections, such as Lyme disease</li>
                    <li>Meningitis</li>
                    <li>Aneurysm</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>After evaluating the results of your headache history, physical examination,  and neurological examination, your physician should be able to determine what type of headache you have, whether or not a serious problem is present  and whether additional tests are needed.</p><br>
                <p>If possible, try to write down how you feel when you are experiencing a headache. Keeping a journal of your headaches  and how they make you feel can be
                    helpful when you are talking to your healthcare provider.</p><br>
                <p>The information you give your healthcare provider about your headaches is the most important part of the diagnosis process. By giving your provider as
                    much information as possible about your headaches, you’re more likely to get an accurate diagnosis  and a treatment plan that will help you feel better.</p><br>
                <p>Although scans  and other imagining tests can be important when ruling out other diseases, they do not help in diagnosing migraines, clusters, or tension-type headaches. However, if your healthcare provider thinks that your headaches are being caused by another medical condition, several imaging tests may be done. A CT scan or MRI can be used if your provider thinks your headaches are connected to an issue with your central nervous system. Both of these tests produce cross-sectional images of the brain that can show any abnormal areas or problems. X-rays of your skull are generally not done. An EEG (electroencephalogram) may not be needed unless you’ve ever passed out during a headache.</p><br>
                <h3>MANAGEMENT  AND TREATMENT</h3><br>
                <h5>How are headaches treated?</h5><br>
                <p>One of the most crucial aspects of treating headaches is figuring out your triggers. Learning what those are — typically by keeping a headache log — can
                    reduce the number of headaches you have.</p><br>
                <p>Once you know your triggers, your healthcare provider can tailor treatment to you. For example, you may get headaches when you’re tense or worried.
                    Counseling  and stress management techniques can help you handle this trigger better. By lowering your stress level, you can avoid stress-induced headaches.</p>
                <p>Not every headache requires medication. A range of treatments is available. Depending on your headache type, frequency,  and cause, treatment options include:</p><br>
                <h5>Stress management</h5><br>
                <p>Stress management teaches you ways to cope with stressful situations. Relaxation techniques help manage stress. You use deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mental images,  and music to ease your tension.</p><br>
                <h3>Biofeedback</h3><br>
                <p>Biofeedback teaches you to recognize when tension is building in your body. You learn how your body responds to stressful situations  and ways to settle them down.</p><br>
                <p>During biofeedback, sensors are connected to your body. They monitor your involuntary physical responses to headaches, which include increases in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breathing rate.</li>
                    <li>Pulse.</li>
                    <li>Heart rate.</li>
                    <li>Temperature.</li>
                    <li>Muscle tension.</li>
                    <li>Brain activity.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h3>Medications</h3><br>
                <p>Occasional tension headaches usually respond well to over-the-counter pain relievers. But be aware that using these medications too often can lead to a long-term daily headache.</p><br>
                <p> For frequent or severe headaches, your provider may recommend prescription headache medications. Triptans  and other types of drugs can stop a migraine attack.
                    You take them at the first signs of an oncoming headache.</p><br>
                <p>Drugs for high blood pressure, seizures,  and depression can sometimes prevent migraines. Your healthcare provider may recommend trying one of these medications
                    to reduce headache frequency.</p><br>
                <h3>PREVENTION</h3><br>
                <h5>How can I prevent headaches?</h5><br>
                <p>The key to preventing headaches is figuring out what triggers them. Triggers are very specific to each person — what gives you a headache may not be a problem for
                    others. Once you determine your triggers, you can avoid or minimize them.</p><br>
                <p>For example, you may find that strong scents set you off. Avoiding perfumes  and scented products can make a big difference in how many headaches you have. The same goes
                    for other common triggers like troublesome foods, lack of sleep,  and poor posture.</p><br>
                <p>Many people, however, are not able to avoid triggers or are unable to identify triggers. In that case, a more personalized multidisciplinary approach with a headache specialist is often necessary.</p><br>
                <h3>OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS</h3><br>
                <h5>Can headaches or migraines be cured?</h5><br>
                <p>Treating health problems that cause headaches, such as high blood pressure, can eliminate head pain. Recently, there have been several new advancements in our
                    understanding of what causes headaches. Although we are closer than ever before to a cure, at this time there is no cure for primary headaches. Treatment focuses
                    on relieving symptoms  and preventing future episodes.</p><br>
                <h3>LIVING WITH</h3><br>
                <h5>What if treatment doesn’t work?</h5><br>
                <p>There are many different ways to address headaches. When you start a treatment program, keep track of your results. A headache log can help you measure progress.
                    Ask yourself:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are my headaches less frequent?</li>
                    <li>Are they less severe?</li>
                    <li>Do they go away faster?</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>If you don’t notice an improvement, talk to your doctor at the next follow-up exam. You may need to try something new.</p><br>
                <h5>When should I see my healthcare provider?</h5><br>
                <p>Most of the time headaches, although painful, don’t pose a serious threat. However, headaches can sometimes be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. Signs
                    you should seek immediate medical care include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confusion or slurred speech.</li>
                    <li>Fever.</li>
                    <li>Headache after head injury.</li>
                    <li>Severe headache that comes on suddenly or headache that doesn’t go away.</li>
                    <li>Seizures or loss of consciousness.</li>
                    <li>Multiple headaches in children.</li>
                    <li>Stiff neck, or pain in the ear or eye.</li>
                    <li>Weakness or numbness.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h5>Are there any headache remedies I can try at home?</h5><br>
                <p>You can treat the occasional, mild headache at home with over-the-counter pain relievers. Other self-care treatments for headaches include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Applying heat or cold packs to your head.</li>
                    <li>Doing stretching exercises.</li>
                    <li>Massaging your head, neck, or back.</li>
                    <li>Resting in a dark  and quiet room.</li>
                    <li>Take a walk.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>Headaches are a very common condition that most people will experience many times during their lives. The main symptom of a headache is  pain in your head or face. This can be throbbing, constant, sharp, or dull. Headaches can be treated with medication, stress management, and biofeedback</p>

                <h5>What Is Hypertension?</h5><br>
                <p>Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition when the pressure exerted by the blood on your vessel wall is abnormally high. Normal blood pressure is around 120/80 mm Hg, where 120 is systolic pressure (exerted during the contraction phase of the heart)  and 80 is the diastolic pressure (exerted during the relaxation phase of the heart). A person is said to have hypertension if it rises above 140/100 mm Hg.</p><br>
                <p>Complications of hypertension cause damage to organs like the heart, brain, kidneys,  and eyes  and include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heart attack  and failure: Chronic hypertension damages the arterial walls  and this reduces the amount of oxygen that is carried to the heart. Once the damage becomes significant, it can set in as a heart attack, which is manifested by extreme chest pain (angina). Also, if left untreated, it can cause permanent heart failure where the heart loses its ability to pump blood.</li>
                    <li>Brain damage (stroke): High blood pressure can also cause rupture or blockage of vessels that supply the brain. Stroke results in the death of the brain
                        cells, which leads to significant disabilities  and impairments.</li>
                    <li>Kidney damage: Damage to renal vessels causes renal failure  and decreased urinary output; this further raises your blood pressure as kidneys fail to remove excess water.</li>
                    <li>Eye damage: Vascular damage in the eyes causes blurry vision, which can progress to complete loss of vision.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>It’s important to address high blood pressure as soon as possible. Our experts will devise management plans accordingly to your goals. Let VCPlus help curb your hypertension.</p><br>

        <!-- 3nd  section -->
        <div class="row align-items-center gy-5 justify-content-evenly min_hight" id="Allergies" style="text-align: justify;">

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
                <br class="only_web">
                <h2 class="header-text-right">Allergies</h2><br>
                <h5>What are allergies?</h5><br>
                <p>Allergies are your body’s reaction to a substance it views as a harmful “invader.” For example, coming into contact with what is normally
                    a harmless substance, such as pollen, might cause your immune system (your body’s defense system) to react. Substances that cause these reactions
                    are called allergens.</p><br>
                <h5>What is an allergic reaction?</h5><br>
                <p>An “allergic reaction” is the way your body responds to the allergen. A chain of events occurs that results in an allergic reaction.
                    If you are prone to allergies, the first time you’re exposed to a specific allergen (such as pollen), your body responds by producing allergic (IgE) antibodies.
                    The job of these antibodies is to find the allergens  and help remove them from your system. As a result, a chemical called histamine is released  and
                    causes symptoms of allergies.</p><br>
                <h5>What are the types of allergies  and how are they treated?</h5><br>
                <p>You can be allergic to a wide variety of substances – including pollen, animal dander, mold, and dust mites.</p><br>
                <h6>Pollen</h6><br>
                <p>Seasonal allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, is an allergic response to pollen. It causes inflammation  and swelling of the lining of your nose  and the protective tissue of your eyes (conjunctiva).</p><br>
                <p>Symptoms include sneezing, congestion (feeling stuffy), and itchy, watery eyes, nose, and mouth. Treatment options include over-the-counter and prescription oral antihistamines, anti-leukotrienes, nasal steroids, nasal antihistamines, and nasal cromolyn. In some people, allergic asthma symptoms (wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and/or chest tightness) can be caused by exposure to pollen.</p><br>
                <p>Your symptoms can be reduced by avoiding pollen. Stay indoors when pollen counts are high, close your windows,
                     and use air conditioning. Ask your healthcare provider about immunotherapy (“allergy shots”) to treat pollen allergy.</p><br>
                <h6>Dust mites</h6><br>
                <p>Dust mites are tiny organisms that live in dust and the fibers of household objects, such as pillows, mattresses, carpets, and upholstery. Dust mites grow in warm, humid areas.</p><br>
                <p>The symptoms of dust mite allergy are similar to those of pollen allergy. To help manage dust mite allergies, try using dust mite encasements
                    (airtight plastic/polyurethane covers) over pillows, mattresses,  and box springs. Also, remove carpet, or vacuum frequently with a high-efficiency
                    filter vacuum cleaner. Treatment may include medications to control your nasal/eye  and chest symptoms. Immunotherapy may be recommended if your
                    symptoms are not adequately controlled with avoidance methods  and medications.</p><br>
                <h6>Molds</h6><br>
                <p>Molds are tiny fungi (like Penicillium) with spores that float in the air like pollen. Mold is a common trigger for allergies.
                    Mold can be found indoors in damp areas, such as the basement, kitchen, or bathroom, as well as outdoors in grass, leaf piles, hay,
                    mulch, or under mushrooms. Mold spores reach a peak during hot, humid weather.
                    Treatment may include medications to control your nasal/eye  and chest symptoms. Immunotherapy may be recommended if your symptoms are not
                    adequately controlled with avoidance  and medications.</p><br>
                <h6>Animal dander</h6><br>
                <p> Allergic reactions can be caused by the proteins secreted by sweat glands in an animal’s skin, which are shed in dander, and by the proteins in an animal’s saliva. Avoidance measures don’t work as well as simply removing the pet from your home. However, because many people are reluctant to do this, second-best measures include keeping your pet out of your bedroom, using air cleaners with HEPA filtration, and washing your pet (cat or dog) frequently.</p><br>
                <h6>Latex</h6><br>
                <p>Some people develop a latex allergy after repeated contact with latex. Rubber gloves, such as those used in surgery or home cleaning, are a major source for causing this
                    type of reaction. Skin rash, hives, eye tearing,  and irritation, wheezing and itching of the skin may occur if you have a latex allergy.</p><br>
                <p>Allergic reactions to latex can be mild, such as skin redness  and itching. More severe reactions can occur if your mucosal membranes are exposed, such as during an
                    operation or a dental or gynecologic exam.</p><br>
                <p>Treatment of latex reactions begins by removing the offending latex product. If you have a latex allergy, you need to wear a Medic Alert® bracelet and carry an emergency epinephrine kit. All procedures should be carried out in a “latex-safe” fashion. There is no cure for latex allergy, so the best treatment for this condition is prevention and avoidance.</p><br>
                <h6>Certain foods</h6><br>
                <p>Food allergies develop when your body develops a specific antibody to a specific food. An allergic reaction occurs within minutes of eating food  and symptoms can be severe.
                <p>In adults, the most common food allergies are shellfish, peanuts,  and tree nuts. In children, they include milk, egg, soy, wheat, shellfish, peanuts,  and tree nuts.</p><br>
                If you have a food allergy, your symptoms include itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulties,  and swelling around your mouth.</p><br>
                <p>It is extremely important to avoid foods that cause allergy symptoms. If you (or your child) have a food allergy, your doctor may prescribe injectable epinephrine
                    (adrenaline) for you to carry at all times. This is needed in case you accidentally eat foods that cause allergies. There are new therapies
                    for peanut allergies called oral immunotherapy.</p><br>
                <h6>Insect venom (stings)</h6><br>
                <p>If you get a bee sting, a normal reaction includes pain, swelling,  and redness around the sting site. A large, local reaction includes swelling that extends beyond the sting site.
                    For example, if you are stung on the ankle, you may see swelling in your leg.</p><br>
                <p>The most serious reaction to an insect sting is an allergic one, which needs immediate medical attention. Symptoms of an allergic reaction to an insect sting include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty breathing.</li>
                    <li>Generalized (widespread) hives that appear as a red, itchy rash that spreads to areas other than the area that was stung.</li>
                    <li>Swelling of your face, throat, or mouth tissue.</li>
                    <li>Wheezing or difficulty swallowing.</li>
                    <li>Restlessness  and anxiety.</li>
                    <li>Rapid pulse.</li>
                    <li>Dizziness or a sharp drop in your blood pressure.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>If you react like this, a re-sting can cause a serious reaction that can be life-threatening.</p><br>
                <p>An allergic reaction is treated with epinephrine (adrenaline). If you’ve had an allergic reaction to bee stings, see a board-certified allergy/immunologist to get
                    a skin  and/or blood test to confirm your allergy to bee venom. Venom immunotherapy is recommended if venom allergy is confirmed. This will help reduce the possibility
                    that a re-sting will cause a serious reaction.</p><br>
                <h5>What is allergic rhinitis?</h5><br>
                <p>Nasal allergy symptoms and hay fever are referred to as “allergic rhinitis.” Seasonal allergic rhinitis is a nasal allergy that changes with the seasons because of pollen from plants (trees, grasses, or weeds). Seasonal symptoms arise during the pollinating seasons for particular plants. Because you can be allergic to more than one thing, your symptoms may get worse at different times throughout the year or maybe constant.</p><br>
                <h5>Does everyone get allergies?</h5>
                <p>No. Most allergies are inherited, which means they are passed on to children by their parents. People inherit a tendency to be allergic, although not to any specific allergen. If your child develops an allergy, you or your partner likely have allergies.</p><br>
                <h3>SYMPTOMS  AND CAUSES</h3><br>
                <h5>What are the symptoms of allergies?</h5><br>
                <p>Allergy symptoms are classified as mild, moderate, or severe:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mild reactions include local symptoms (affecting a specific area of your body) such as a rash or hives, itchiness, watery/red eyes, hay fever,  and runny nose.
                        Mild reactions do not spread to other parts of your body.</li>
                    <li>Moderate reactions include symptoms that spread to other parts of your body. Symptoms may include itchiness, hives  and/or swelling,  and trouble breathing.</li>
                    <li>A severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, is a rare, life-threatening emergency in which your body’s response to the allergen is sudden  and affects the whole body.
                        Anaphylaxis may begin with severe itching of your eyes or face. Within minutes, more serious symptoms appear, including throat swelling (which could cause problems with
                        swallowing  and breathing), abdominal pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, hives,  and swelling (angioedema). You may also have mental confusion or dizziness, since anaphylaxis
                        may cause a drop in blood pressure.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h5>What causes allergies?</h5><br>
                <p>Anything that you come into contact with that your body views as a “harmful invader” can be a cause of an allergy. Normally harmless substances that are
                    common causes of allergies include pollen, animal dander, mold, dust, foods, insect venom,  and latex</p><br>
                <p>Technically, your symptoms are the result of a chain of events that are your body’s response to the “harmful invader.” Your body “sees” the invader,
                    makes antibodies to fight the invader  and in so doing, releases histamines that cause your allergy symptoms.</p><br>
                <h3>DIAGNOSIS  AND TESTS</h3><br>
                <h5>How are allergies diagnosed?</h5><br>
                <p>If you think you have allergies, don't wait to see if your symptoms go away.</p><br>
                <p>When your symptoms last longer than a week or two  and tend to come back, make an appointment with an allergy/immunology specialist.</p><br>
                <p>Allergy skin testing may be used to identify the allergens that are causing your allergy symptoms. The test is performed by pricking your skin with an extract of an allergen and then checking your skin’s reaction. If a skin test can’t be performed, blood work may be obtained. This test is not as sensitive as a skin test. The test evaluates the number of antibodies produced by your immune system. Higher levels of certain antibodies suggest a possible allergy to that allergen. Other types of allergy testing are available too.</p><br>
                <h3>MANAGEMENT  AND TREATMENT</h3><br>
                <p>How are allergies treated?</p><br>
                <p>Although avoiding the allergen is an important treatment approach, it usually doesn’t completely end the allergic reaction.</p><br>
                <p>Medications such as antihistamines (e.g., Allegra®, Zyrtec®), decongestants (eg, Sudafed®, Contact®), or a combination of over-the-counter  and prescription medications, are used to treat your allergy symptoms. Nasal sprays such as topical nasal steroids (e.g., Flonase®, Nasonex®), cromolyn sodium,  and topical nasal antihistamines also can be used to treat allergy symptoms.
                    Asthma medications, which reduce allergy symptoms, include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inhaled bronchodilators.</li>
                    <li>Inhaled steroids.</li>
                    <li>Oral bronchodilators (theophylline).</li>
                    <li>Oral anti-leukotrienes (montelukast [Singulair®], zafirlukast [Accolate®]  and zileuton [Zyflo®]).</li>
                    <li>Injected medications, such as omalizumab (Xolair®), dupilumab (Dupixent®), reslizumab (Cinqair®), benralizumab (Fasenra®), or Mepolizumab (Nucala®).</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Immunotherapy (“allergy shot therapy”) or allergy oral immunotherapy is recommended if your symptoms aren’t adequately controlled with a combination of
                    avoidance measures  and regular medication use. This shot has been shown to be effective in properly selected patients with allergic rhinitis  and/or allergic asthma.</p><br>
                <p>Another treatment option is saline irrigation using a sinus rinse kit. These rinse kits (e.g., Neilmed®) are sold over-the-counter or can be made at home.
                    To make your rinse, combine one-half teaspoon non-iodinated salt with one-half teaspoon baking soda in eight ounces of distilled or boiled water.
                    This mixture rinses out allergens  and decreases the amount of inflammation (edema) they cause.</p><br>
                <h3>OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS</h3><br>
                <p>Can allergies be cured?</p><br>
                <p>Allergies can’t be cured, but symptoms can be controlled using a combination of avoidance measures  and medications, as well as allergen immunotherapy in properly selected cases</p>

                <h2 class="header-text-right">Bronchitis</h2><br>

                <p>Is bronchitis keeping you from seeing a doctor? Well, tune in to our clinic  and enjoy expert services from the comfort of your couch.</p><br>
                <h5>What Is Bronchitis?</h5><br>
                <p>Bronchitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the bronchi in the lungs. Bronchitis is usually infectious but can also occur
                    due to environmental factors such as allergens  and smoking that irritate the bronchial lining  and cause inflammation.</p><br>
                <p> The most common cause of long-standing bronchitis is smoking. Other causes include occupational pollution and other environmental pollutants. These factors increase the susceptibility of your respiratory tract to develop inflammation following a bacterial or viral infection. The obstruction of air passageways by thick and infectious mucous makes it fairly difficult to breathe. Hence if left untreated, chronic bronchitis can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><br>
                <h5>What Are The Symptoms Of Bronchitis?</h5><br>
                <p>Symptoms include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coughing</li>
                    <li>Wheezing sounds  and shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Excess mucus production in the throat</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>If you have a cough that has lasted for about 3 months with consistent thick mucus production, you are likely suffering from chronic bronchitis.</p><br>
                <p>The experts at our telehealth clinic assess your status based upon clinical signs  and symptoms  and devise the safest medical plan.</p><br>
                <h5>What Should I Do If I Have Bronchitis?</h5><br>
                <p>If you have acute bronchitis, consultation with an expert is always the best way forward. Most cases of acute bronchitis resolve naturally because of the own immune system.
                    Taking antibiotics only helps resolve the symptoms early but at the expense of developing antibiotic resistance in bacteria. So, before you put your shoes into anything, talk
                    to our experts from the convenience of your homes  and get professional opinions to help you deal with your bronchitis.</p><br>
                <p>So if you have bronchitis, don’t hesitate to book your appointment right away.</p><br>

                <h5>What Is Constipation?</h5>
                <p>Constipation is a condition characterized by hard stools that are very difficult to expel from the intestines.
                    These stools lead to forceful bowel movements that can be painful. </p><br>
                <h5>What Are Symptoms Of Constipation?</h5><br>
                <p>Constipation is not a life-threatening condition unless it’s chronic. People with constipation have difficulty in passing stools. They face constant abdominal bloating and a significant drop in appetite. Failure to pass hard stools also causes stomachaches, and you might also experience bloody stools. It is advisable to contact your physician if your constipation has lasted for more than 2 weeks. Book an appointment now and let us connect you with an expert physician to resolve your concerns.</p><br>
                <h5>What Should I Do If I Have Constipation?</h5><br>
                <p>Constipation can usually be reverted by eating a balanced diet with good fiber content along with maintaining an adequate level of hydration. Things that can fuel constipation should be avoided such as caffeine as it generally dehydrates your stools. Also, some people get constipation after consuming dairy products. Hence, these people are advised to limit their dairy consumption. Acute or short-term constipation is usually not a big issue and can be quickly corrected with laxatives. On the contrary, long-standing (chronic) constipation can lead to hemorrhoids, bloody stools, permanent obstruction, and even prolapse of the rectum (a condition where your rectum bulges out).</p><br>

                <p>Do you often feel burning sensations in your chest after you eat a meal? If yes, contact our experts to discuss your condition.
                    We offer the best clinicians to help you out with a swift  and easy recovery.</p><br>
                <h5>What Is Heartburn?</h5><br>
                <p>
Heartburn, medically known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a condition when the acid from your stomach propels backward toward the esophagus. The esophagus, commonly known as the food pipe, is a muscular tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. The food that you eat goes down the esophagus through muscular movements called peristalsis. When it reaches the bottom of the esophagus, a ring of muscles called the lower esophageal sphincter, allows its passage into the stomach. It then closes to prevent any backflow of food.</p><br>
                <p>In GERD, the lower esophageal sphincter becomes weak  and allows retrograde movement of the stomach contents. Also, the gastric acid goes back up into the esophagus  and damages it.
                    What Are The Symptoms Of Heartburn?</p><br>
                <p>Gastroesophageal reflux presents with very obvious symptoms:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>You feel a burning in your chest, just below the breastbone  and this burning is aggravated with a bending  and a lying posture. Also, it worsens on eating a meal.</li>
                    <li>It’s fairly difficult to eat or swallow food. You feel like the food is trapped just below your chest.</li>
                    <li>Nausea  and regurgitation of food are also common symptoms observed in GERD.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Moreover, GERD can also cause symptoms such as a sore throat  and hoarseness of voice. The acid that is flushed back into the esophagus is strong enough to
                    create ulcers in its wall. There is also persistent inflammation of the esophageal wall that leads to narrowing and the development of strictures.</p><br>
                <p>The most serious complication of a long-standing GERD is metaplasia (change in the epithelial lining of the esophagus). It is called a Barret’s Esophagus and it predisposes a person to esophageal cancer.</p><br>
                <h5>What Should I Do If I Have Heartburn?</h5><br>
                <p>If you feel burning in your chest, you can consult our doctors for effective treatment. In case your GERD is
                    due to a hiatal hernia, you’ll be subjected to diagnostic imaging. </p><br>

                <p>At VCPlus, we provide consistent support to help people with diabetes. Appointments with exerting physicians are just a click away.</p><br>

                <h5>What Is Diabetes?</h5><br>
                <p>Diabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar levels become too high. It occurs due to the dysfunction of your body’s sugar-regulating mechanisms.
                <p>Because it has affected millions of people worldwide, diabetes has become a global health concern.
                    Normally, whenever there is an increase in your blood sugar level (say after you eat a meal), your pancreas releases a hormone called insulin to bring it down.
                    In diabetes, this regulatory mechanism is disturbed such that either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells do not respond to insulin despite its
                    normal circulatory levels.</p><br>
                <p>In Type I diabetes, the body is deficient in insulin. The deficit in insulin is a result of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin.
                    Lack of insulin leads to high blood sugar levels.</p><br>
                <br>
                <p>In Type 2 diabetes, the cells of the body don’t react to insulin (a phenomenon called insulin resistance). This type of diabetes is most commonly associated with obesity. Of both types, Type 2 is more common (90 % of people have Type 2 diabetes).</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What Are Symptoms Of Diabetes?</h5><br>
                <p>Symptoms of diabetes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excessive hunger  and thirst (due to excessive urination)</li>
                    <li>Fatigue  and weight loss</li>
                    <li>The blurring of vision  and headache</li>
                    <li>Slow healing of wounds</li>
                    <li>Frequent gum  and skin infections</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Complications of diabetes arise due to the damaging effects of high blood sugar levels on blood vessels. Microvascular damage in the eyes leads to diabetic retinopathy, which significantly impacts vision. Similarly, damage to renal vessels leads to diabetic nephropathy in which the kidneys do not function properly (which leads to a build-up of wastes in the body). Other complications include nerve damage and sexual dysfunction.</p><br>

                <p>If you have diabetes, connect to our expert doctors without delay. We will formulate the best treatment plan for your condition. Also,

                <p>Diarrhea is a condition in which you get frequent loose and watery stools. Usually, the condition develops and then resolves on its own over a few days. During this time, it can create abdominal bloating and cramping in the lower abdomen but never something serious. Sometimes, however, it can create serious complications.</p><br>
                <p>Diarrhea causes dehydration  and if not corrected, it leads to a significant electrolyte imbalance in the body. This In Turns Gives Rise To Renal Failure  and Other
                    Important Bodily Functions.</p><br>
                <h5>What Are The Symptoms Of Severe Diarrhea?</h5><br>
                <p>Where mild diarrhea manifests as watery stools with mild abdominal cramps and bloating, severe diarrhea can also cause other significant symptoms. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Severe pain</li>
                    <li>Vomiting </li>
                    <li>Blood</li>
                    <li> loss  and fever</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h5>What Should I Do If I Have Severe Diarrhea?</h5><br>
                <p>Severe diarrhea  and associated dehydration can create serious complications. Symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dark urine with a significantly decreased urinary output</li>
                    <li>Dry skin with a rapid heartbeat</li>
                    <li>Lightheadedness</li>
                    <li>Severe nausea  and vomiting</li>
                    <li> and Headaches</li>

                <h5>What is influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p>The flu is a respiratory infection caused by a virus (germ). Influenza occurs most often during the winter  and easily spreads from person to person.
                    The "flu season" in the Northern hemisphere runs from October to May  and usually peaks between December  and February.</p><br>
                <p>Most people who get influenza feel sick for a week or two  and recover. In some people, the flu leads to more serious lung infections or to worsening of
                    underlying conditions, such as heart failure or emphysema.</p><br>
                <h3>SYMPTOMS  AND CAUSES</h3><br>
                <h5>What are the symptoms of influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sudden onset of moderate to high fever.</li>
                    <li>Dry cough.</li>
                    <li>Headache.</li>
                    <li>Sore throat.</li>
                    <li>Chills.</li>
                    <li>Runny nose.</li>
                    <li>Loss of appetite.</li>
                    <li>Muscle aches.</li>
                    <li>Tiredness.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Many conditions — such as a common cold, diarrhea, and vomiting — are called "the flu," but are not influenza. “Stomach flu” is a misnomer, since viruses other than the flu cause such illness.</p>
                <h5>How can you tell the difference between a common cold  and influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p>Many cold  and flu symptoms are similar. Both the common cold  and the flu are caused by viruses.
                    There are some differences with influenza. Symptoms of influenza often hit suddenly  and cause you to become weaker  and weaker. While the more uncomfortable symptoms
                    of flu generally last from three to seven days, the dry cough  and fatigue of influenza can last two to three weeks. Signs that influenza is getting worse include
                    an increasing degree of fever  and shortness of breath. If you think that your illness is getting worse, contact your doctor right away.</p><br>

                <h3>DIAGNOSIS  AND TESTS</h3><br>
                <h5>When should you contact your doctor about influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p>It’s important to take flu medicines very early (within 48 hours of coming down with symptoms),
                    so you should contact your doctor as soon as you think you may have the flu.</p><br>
                <h3>MANAGEMENT  AND TREATMENT</h3><br>
                <h5>How is influenza (flu) treated?</h5><br>
                <p>Most people with influenza who are otherwise healthy do not need special drugs or treatments. If you have the flu, you should:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rest.</li>
                    <li>Drink lots of fluids.</li>
                    <li>Eat a light diet.</li>
                    <li>Stay at home.</li>
                    <li>Take acetaminophen (such as Tylenol®) to reduce fever  and relieve muscle aches.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <i>Note: Adults should not give aspirin to children or adolescents with fevers due to the association with Reye's syndrome, a rare disorder
                    that causes brain  and liver damage.</i><br>
                <h5>Can you get medicine for influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p>If you are seriously ill, your doctor might order an antiviral drug for you. Antiviral drugs for influenza include oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®);
                    zanamivir (Relenza®); peramivir (Rapivap®);  and baloxavir (Xofluza®).</p><br>
                <h6>Oseltamivir phosphate</h6><br>
                <p>This drug is approved to treat influenza in patients who are two weeks of age,  and older,
                     and it works best in people who have had the flu for fewer than two days. It is also approved to prevent
                    flu in patients who are one year of age  and older. There is a generic version of this product available, but it
                    costs nearly as much as the brand name. Potential side effects include nausea, vomiting, nosebleeds, headaches,  and tiredness.</p><br>
                <h6>Zanamivir</h6><br>
                <p>This drug is approved to treat flu in patients seven years old  and older  and to prevent flu in patients who are five  and older.
                    This product is inhaled  and not recommended for people who have respiratory illnesses like COPD or asthma. Common side effects include headaches,
                    nausea, diarrhea, nose irritation,  and vomiting.</p><br>
                <h6>Peramivir</h6><br>
                <p>This drug is approved to treat flu in people 2 years old  and older.
                    This product is given into the vein (intravenously) by a healthcare provider. A common side effect of peramivir is diarrhea.</p><br>
                <h6>Baloxavir</h6><br>
                <p>This drug, a pill, is approved to treat flu in people 12 years old  and older who are otherwise healthy  and in people who are at higher risk of developing influenza-related complications. Common side effects are diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea,  and headaches.
                    The side effects mentioned for the above drugs are only the most common. There are other possible side effects. As with any type of medication, you might be allergic. Please discuss side effects with your doctor or pharmacist.
                    Amantadine  and rimantidine have also been approved to treat influenza, but flu viruses are widely resistant to them.</p><br>
                <h5>What complications are associated with influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p>Infections from bacteria are more likely when you have influenza.
                    Healthcare providers treat these bacterial infections with antibiotic drugs. Common secondary infections include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bacterial pneumonia.</li>
                    <li>Ear infections.</li>
                    <li>Sinus infections. </li>
                </ul><br>
                <h3>PREVENTION</h3><br>
                <h5>Can you prevent influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p>Yes. If you get the flu vaccine, you are likely to be protected from the flu for the duration of the flu season. The vaccine is given as a shot or a nasal spray. You must get the vaccine every year in the fall to be protected. Sometimes the vaccine does not prevent you from getting the flu but makes the flu less severe if you do get it. The vaccine is safe, even for pregnant women. You can’t get the flu from the ‘flu shot.’
                    In addition, some of the antivirals (Relenza  and Tamiflu) given to treat flu can be given to prevent flu in people who are in close contact with people who have the flu.
                    Because the flu is so contagious, you can do other things that may help you prevent getting or spreading the flu:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Practice good hand-washing hygiene. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap  and water. If you aren’t able to use soap  and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
                    <li>Avoid being around other people when you do not feel well, especially when you have a fever.</li>
                    <li>Avoid being around sick people whenever possible.</li>
                    <li> Avoid touching your eyes, nose,  and mouth.</li>
                    <li> Eat well, exercise,  and get enough rest.</li>
                    <li> Consider taking a multivitamin  and possibly vitamin D supplements to support your immune system. (Ask your healthcare provider if they think you need extra D.)</li>
                </ul>
                <h5> Who should get the flu vaccine?</h5>
                <p>It’s recommended that everyone 6 months or older should get an influenza vaccine each year. You will protect yourself  and other people around you. People who have any of the following conditions are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from influenza :</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Lung disease.</li>
                    <li> Kidney disease.</li>
                    <li> Liver disease.</li>
                    <li> Neurologic diseases.</li>
                    <li> Diabetes.</li>
                    <li> Heart problems.</li>
                    <li> An illness that weakens the immune system, or if you are taking a medicine that weakens the immune system, thus making it hard for your body to fight illnesses.</li>
                    <li> Blood disorders.</li>
                    <li> Obesity</li>
                </ul>

                <p> You also have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from influenza if you:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Are younger than 2 years, or over 65 years old.</li>
                    <li> Are pregnant  and for 2 weeks after delivery.</li>
                    <li> Are under 19 years old  and must take aspirin regularly.</li>
                    <li>Live in a nursing home.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> If you work in a healthcare facility, you may transmit influenza to patients  and other workers, but you are not at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill. The recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention is that everyone over the age of 6 months gets a flu vaccine if there are no contraindications. This includes individuals who are not at high risk.</p>
                <h5> Who shouldn’t get the flu vaccine?</h5><br>
                <p> You shouldn’t get the influenza shot if you are</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Severely allergic to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine, regardless of the vaccine component (so including eggs) suspected of being responsible for the reaction.</li>
                    <li> Sick with a fever. (Wait until you are better.)</li>
                    There is an option to get the nasal flu vaccine (administered through your nose). The following groups of people shouldn't get the nasal flu vaccine:
                    <li>Children  and adolescents who are taking aspirin or any type of salicylate-containing medication therapies.</li>
                    <li> Children who are 2-4 years of age who have been diagnosed with asthma or whose parents/caregivers can say that a healthcare provider has told them during the past 12 months that the child has had wheezing events or asthma; or a child who has a wheezing episode documented in their medical record.</li>
                    <li> Children or adults whose immune systems are compromised for any reason, including drugs or HIV infection.</li>
                    <li> Caregivers or close contacts of severely immunosuppressed people who need a protected environment.</li>
                    <li> Pregnant people.</li>
                    <li> People who have received antiviral drugs to treat the flu within the past 48 hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    (Please remember that the above list is for people who should not receive the NASAL flu vaccine. It does not refer to the flu shot.)</p><br>
                <h5>When should you get the flu vaccine?</h5><br>
                <p>The best time to get the flu vaccine is in the early fall. It takes about 3 weeks for the vaccine to exert its protective benefits, so don’t delay receiving it.

                <h5>Why is influenza (flu) more dangerous for elderly or chronically ill people?</h5><br>
                <p> People over 65  and those with chronic(long-term) illnesses have hard time-fighting influenza because the body’s system for fighting infections is often weakened by age  and illness. In older people, influenza is also more likely to lead to:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Pneumonia.</li>
                    <li> Hospitalization.</li>
                    <li> Death.</li>

                <h3>LIVING WITH</h3><br>

                <h5>When should you contact your healthcare provider if you have influenza (flu)?</h5><br>
                <p> Because of the importance of taking flu medicines within 48 hours of coming down with symptoms, call immediately if you think you have the flu. If you continue to feel unwell after you have been treated for the flu, you should call your doctor’s office. If you find yourself feeling better  and then getting sick again, you should also contact your doctor. The flu might have left you with some kind of secondary illness, like a sinus infection.</p><br>
                <h5> When should you go back to work or school if you have had the flu?</h5><br>
                <p>You are contagious for one day before starting feeling ill  and for 5 to 7 days while you have the flu symptoms. At the very least, you should stay at home until can go 24 hours without taking something for fever. If you have other severe symptoms, such as incessant (non-stop) cough or shortness of breath, you should stay at home.</p><br>

                <h2>Gout</h2><br>
                <p>A gout is a painful form of arthritis. When your body has extra uric acid, sharp crystals may form in the big toe or other joints, causing episodes of swelling  and pain called gout attacks. Gout is treatable with medications  and changes in diet  and lifestyle.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3><br>
                <h5>What is gout?</h5><br>
                <p>Doctors place gout under the umbrella term “arthritis” — a broad range of joint diseases  and joint pain. Some forms of arthritis inflame joints, while others don’t.A Gout is a common form of inflammatory arthritis. It’s due to a crystal called uric acid.<br><br>
                   A gout causes pain  and swelling in one or more joints. It typically affects the big toe. But it’s also found in other joints, including the knee, ankle, foot, hand, wrist,  and elbow.
                </p>
                <h3>Who is affected by gout?</h3><br>
                <p>A gout can affect anyone. It usually occurs earlier in men than women. It generally occurs after menopause in women. Men can be three times more likely than women to get it because they have higher levels of uric acid most of their lives. Women reach these uric acid levels after menopause.</p>
                <br>
                <p>People are more likely to get gout if they have:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Obesity, or a lot of extra weight.</li>
                    <li>Congestive heart failure.</li>
                    <li>Diabetes.</li>
                    <li>Family history of gout.</li>
                    <li>Hypertension (high blood pressure)./li>
                    <li>Kidney disease.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>You are also more likely to develop gout if you:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consume a diet high in animal proteins</li>
                    <li>Consume a significant amount of alcohol</li>
                    <li>Are on water pills (diuretics).</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h3>SYMPTOMS  AND CAUSES</h3>
                <h5>What causes gout?</h5><br>
                <p>The human body makes uric acid during the breakdown of chemicals called purines found in certain food  and drinks. This normal byproduct goes through the kidneys  and exits the body when you pee.<br>
                    Sometimes the body produces too much uric acid. Or the kidneys can’t do a good job handling it. When the body has high levels of uric acid or hyperuricemia, uric acid crystals can concentrate in the joints. The sharp, needle-like crystals cause gout. However, many people with higher uric acid levels never get gout.
                </p><br>
                <h5>What are the symptoms of gout?</h5><br>
                <p>An episode of gout is called a gout attack. Gout attacks are very painful  and can happen quite suddenly, often overnight. During a gout attack, symptoms in the affected joint(s) may include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intense pain.</li>
                    <li>Redness.</li>
                    <li>Stiffness.</li>
                    <li>Swelling.</li>
                    <li>Tenderness, even to light touch, such as from a bedsheet.</li>
                    <li>Warmth or a feeling like the joint is “on fire.”</li>
                    <li>How long does a gout attack last?</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>A gout attack can last a week or two. Between gout attacks, you may have no symptoms at all.</p><br>
                <h5>How often do gout attacks happen?</h5><br>
                <p>Some people have gout attacks frequently, while others go years between episodes. If gout isn’t treated, attacks may become more frequent  and last longer. Gout attacks can happen over  and over again in the same joint or affect different joints.</p><br>
                <h3>DIAGNOSIS  AND TESTS</h3><br>
                <h5>How does a doctor diagnose gout?</h5><br>
                <p>If you have sudden or severe pain in a joint, you should talk to your primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP may send you to a rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in gout  and other kinds of arthritis.</p><br>
                <p>Healthcare providers consider several things when confirming gout:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Symptoms: </b> The provider will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they happen  and how long they last.</li>
                    <li><b>Physical examination: </b> Your provider will examine the affected joint(s) to look for swelling, redness,  and warmth.</li>
                    <li><b>Blood work: </b>A test can measure the amount of uric acid in your blood.</li>
                    <li><b>Imaging tests: </b>You may have pictures taken of the affected joint(s) with X-rays, an ultrasound, or MRI.</li>
                    <li><b>Aspiration:</b> The provider may use a needle to pull fluid from the joint. Using a microscope, a team member can look for uric acid crystals (confirming gout) or a different problem (such as bacteria with infection or another type of crystal).</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h3>MANAGEMENT  AND TREATMENT</h3><br>
                <h5>How is gout treated?</h5><br>
                <p>Your healthcare provider may prescribe certain medications to treat gout.</p><br>
                <p>Some drugs help control symptoms:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>NSAIDs can reduce pain  and swelling. Some people with kidney disease, stomach ulcers,  and other health problems are unable to take NSAIDs.</li>
                    <li>Colchicine can reduce inflammation  and pain if you take it within 24 hours of a gout attack. It’s given by mouth.</li>
                    <li>Corticosteroids can relieve pain  and swelling. You take steroids by mouth or with an injection.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Drugs that help lower levels of uric acid in your body to prevent or reduce future episodes of gout attacks:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allopurinol, taken as a pill.</li>
                    <li>Febuxostat, taken as a pill.</li>
                    <li>Pegloticase, given as an intravenous (in the vein) infusion.</li>
                    <li>Probenecid, taken as a pill.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h3>PREVENTION</h3><br>
                <h5>Can I prevent gout?</h5><br>
                <p>You can make certain lifestyle changes to help prevent gout:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drink plenty of water to help your kidneys function better  and avoid dehydration.</li>
                    <li>Exercise regularly to stay at a healthy weight. Extra weight increases uric acid in your body  and puts more stress on joints.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Do your best to limit the purines in your body, since these chemicals can trigger uric acid buildup. Foods  and drinks containing high purine levels include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Red meat  and organ meats (liver, for example).</li>
                    <li>Shellfish.</li>
                    <li>Gravy.</li>
                    <li>Drinks  and foods high in fructose (fruit sugar).</li>
                    <li>Protein from animal sources. All protein from animal flesh can potentially lead to elevated uric acid levels.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Certain medications can lead to elevated uric acid levels. These medications include:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diuretics, also known as “water pills.”</li>
                    <li>Immunosuppressants or drugs are used to slow the immune system (common in organ transplants, for example).</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h5>OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS</h5><br>
                <h3>When should I call my healthcare provider about gout symptoms?</h3><br>
                <p>If you experience sudden, intense pain in a joint, call a healthcare provider right away. If the joint is hot  and inflamed, you might have gout — or you might have another problem like an infection.</p><br>
                <h5>What’s the outlook for people with gout?</h5><br>
                <p>Untreated gout can lead to permanent joint damage. The buildup of uric acid in the joints  and soft tissue is called tophus. Some people with gout can also develop other health problems, such as severe arthritis, kidney stones,  and heart disease. It’s important to discuss your symptoms with a healthcare provider.</p><br>
                <h3>LIVING WITH</h3><br>
                <h5>How can I manage a gout attack?</h5><br>
                <p>When you have a gout attack, you can manage your symptoms by:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid alcohol  and sweet drinks.</li>
                    <li>Drinking plenty of fluids.</li>
                    <li>Elevating the joint(s).</li>
                    <li>Putting ice on the joint(s).</li>
                    <li>Limiting any stress on the joint(s).</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h5>What else should I ask my healthcare provider about gout?</h5><br>
                <p>Consider asking your healthcare provider:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is causing gout?</li>
                    <li>Do I have any joint damage?</li>
                    <li>What can I do to prevent future attacks?</li>
                    <li>Can any gout medications help me?</li>
                    <li>How long will I need to take gout medications?</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Gout is a painful form of arthritis. Extra uric acid in your body creates sharp crystals in the joints, leading to swelling  and extreme tenderness. Gout usually starts in the big toe but can affect other joints. Gout is a treatable condition  and the uric acid level can be decreased by medication  and lifestyle changes. Talk to your healthcare provider about medications that can reduce uric acid levels. They can also discuss changes you can make to your diet  and lifestyle to prevent  and reduce gout attacks.</p><br>

                <p>At VCPlus, we offer the best ENT specialists from across the globe. Book your appointment now.</p><br>
                <h5>What Is An Earache?</h5><br>
                <p>Pain in the ear is can be mild or severe. Although sometimes it originates in the ear itself, most of the time it is a referred pain. A referred pain is a pain that originates somewhere else and then gets transferred to another part owing to a similar nerve supply. Thus usually, ear pain is a referred pain of tonsillitis or sinusitis.</p><br>
                <h5>What Are The Symptoms Of Earaches?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Conditions related to the ear itself that result in an earache are as follows:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Ear Stuffiness</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Collection of fluid inside the ear often results in pain. Of special interest is the collection of fluid in the middle ear (cavity of the ear behind the eardrum). Fluid collected here provides a breeding ground for bacteria. These in turn cause an infection  and the resulting increased pressure causes serious pain.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>A Blocked Eustachian Tube</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The eustachian tube is a narrow tube that connects the back of your nose to the middle ear cavity. Obstruction of this tube due to colds and the flu affects the outflow of fluid from the middle ear, resulting in a buildup of fluid, which causes earache. A Eustachian tube block also creates negative pressure inside the middle ear. This leads to a bend in the eardrum toward the middle ear that can be detected with an otoscope (the instrument used to visualize the ear internally).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Ear Barotraumas</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Earache can also develop as a result of pressure differences between the inside  and outside of your eardrum. One of the causes is a blocked eustachian tube. Others include extreme changes in altitude such as flying or taking a trip to the mountains.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Mastoiditis</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A bacterial infection of the bone behind the ear (mastoid bone) also causes intense earache.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What Should I Do If I Have An Earache?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>An earache that fails to go away can be managed with medication. So, if you have an earache that is bothering you, talk to our experts now. You can get professional opinions, consultations,  and treatments just a click away.</p>

                <h2>Eye Infections</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Eye infections are very common  and can cause serious irritation. But you’ve got VCPlus at your disposal.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What Is Conjunctivitis?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin membrane that covers the white part of your eye. This type of inflammation can be fueled by an infection, allergy, or mechanical irritation. More so, it can target a single eye or both eyes.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What Are The Symptoms Of Conjunctivitis?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Conjunctivitis displays a wide array of symptoms  and these mostly depend upon the underlying cause. Some common symptoms are:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pink or red eyes: </b>The blood vessels of the sclera (white of the eye) dilate with an increase in their permeability (one of the basic signs of inflammation). This causes the sclera to look red. If you have red eyes, talk to our doctors right away because, sometimes, it’s not just red-eye but a much deeper complication.</li>
                    <li><b>Irritated eyes: </b>Your eyes feel itchy  and uncomfortable. However, there is no pain associated with them.</li>
                    <li><b>Discharge from the eyes: </b>The color and quality of the discharge depend upon if you have bacterial or viral conjunctivitis. Bacterial causes lead to yellow-greenish discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis causes the watery discharge.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h5>What Is Keratitis?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea (the transparent dome in front of the eye). It is most commonly due to an infection or injury  and, if left untreated, can cause corneal ulcers, scarring,  and loss of vision.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What Are The Symptoms Of Keratitis?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>The symptoms of keratitis include painful and itchy eyes, blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and watery discharge. If keratitis is not treated in time, it can lead to corneal ulcers and scarring and significantly hamper vision.</p>
                <br>

                <h5>Who is at risk for getting itchy genitals?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Both males  and females of all ages are at risk of getting itchy genitals.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>SYMPTOMS  AND CAUSES</h3>
                <br>
                <h5>What causes itchy genitals?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Itchy genitals can be a symptom of many conditions. These may include vaginal infections in females or jock itch in males. In either sex, itching can be caused by skin irritation, sexually transmitted diseases,  and allergies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In many cases, itchy genitals caused by irritation will clear up on their own if the irritants (lotions or soaps for example) are removed. Other causes of itching may require more intensive treatment. If you are concerned about itchiness in your genitals that do not go away, talk to your healthcare provider.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What aggravates itchy genitals?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Sweating, tight clothing,  and substances like soap  and detergent can aggravate itchy genitals caused by a skin condition.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Are itchy genitals a sign of a STD (sexually transmitted disease)?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Itchy genitals in a woman can be caused by trichomoniasis, a type of sexually transmitted disease. Genital herpes can also cause itchiness.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>DIAGNOSIS  AND TESTS</h3>
                <br>
                <h5>What tests are done to diagnose itchy genitals?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Itchy genitals are self-reported symptoms of various conditions and infections. Your healthcare provider may have to examine your skin for the following:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color of your skin (red, white, brown).</li>
                    <li>A change in the texture of your skin (thickening).</li>
                    <li>Surface abnormalities (dryness, scales).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Your healthcare provider may need to confirm a diagnosis by taking a scraping of your skin or performing a biopsy.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>What questions might my healthcare provider ask to diagnose itchy genitals?</h5>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where is your itch located?</li>
                    <li>How often do you need to scratch?</li>
                    <li>Are you able to stop scratching?</li>
                    <li>How bad is your itchiness?</li>
                    <li>Does it keep you awake at night?</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Try not to scratch! In some cases, the more you scratch the itchier the skin gets. You might also tear your skin, causing bleeding, soreness,  and/or burning. Torn skin can sometimes become infected.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>MANAGEMENT  AND TREATMENT</h3>
                <br>
                <h5>How are itchy genitals treated? What medicines may relieve itchy genitals?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>The treatment for your itchy genitals depends on the cause. If you have eczema, your healthcare provider may prescribe steroid creams. Lichen sclerosis responds to phototherapy (light therapy). Antifungal medications are often prescribed for jock itch. Your healthcare provider will diagnose you  and recommend the best treatment.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Who will treat my itchy genitals?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Itchy genitals can be treated by your primary healthcare provider. However, if your skin condition is severe, you might want to get a referral to a dermatologist, a healthcare provider who specializes in skin.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>PREVENTION</h3>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>Females should take the following steps to help avoid itchy genitals:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>After urination or bowel movements, wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from the anus (rectum) from entering your vagina.</li>
                    <li>Avoid chemical products such as vaginal douches or feminine hygiene sprays, which can upset the acidic balance of your vagina.</li>
                    <li>Avoid the use of excessive amounts of laundry detergent in the washing machine.</li>
                    <li>Stay away from over-the-counter itch blockers, as these products can make the itching worse in the long term.</li>
                    <li>If you suspect a lubricant might be worsening the itching, talk to your healthcare provider about the best options.</li>
                    <li>Avoid trauma to the area, such as excessive shaving  and scratching.</li>
                    <li>Eat a well-balanced diet to maintain healthy bacteria in the vagina.</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Males should take the following steps to help avoid itchy genitals:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your penis well, including the area under the foreskin in uncircumcised men.</li>
                    <li>If you sweat throughout the day, consider changing your underwear frequently.</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Both males  and females should take the following steps to help prevent itchy genitals:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Keep your genital area clean  and dry. Use mild soap, or better yet, avoid soap completely  and rinse well with water. Avoid over-cleaning the area.</li>
                    <li> Wear loose, natural-fiber underwear  and clothing. Change your underwear at least every 24 hours.</li>
                    <li> Dry off thoroughly after bathing  and swimming. Avoid staying in wet clothing for long periods.</li>
                    <li> Avoid unprotected sex, especially if you are worried that you or your partner might have an infection.</li>

                </ul>

                <br>
                <p>The prognosis depends on what’s causing the itch.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Psoriasis, for example, has no cure. However, the symptoms can be managed. Trichomoniasis is curable. With treatment, it can clear up in about a week. Ask your healthcare provider about a timeline based on your diagnosis.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Can itchy genitals go away on their own?</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Yes, but if the itch gets worse or lasts for a long time, you should be evaluated by your healthcare provider. You might have mild skin irritation, or it might be something more serious such as a sexually transmitted disease.</p>
